note

`BaseWindow` provides a flexible way to compose multiple web views in a
single window. For windows with only a single, full-size web view, the
[`BrowserWindow`](/docs/latest/api/browser-window) class may be a simpler option.

This module cannot be used until the `ready` event of the `app`
module is emitted.

```
// In the main process.
const { BaseWindow, WebContentsView } = require('electron')

const win = new BaseWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 })

const leftView = new WebContentsView()
leftView.webContents.loadURL('https://electronjs.org')
win.contentView.addChildView(leftView)

const rightView = new WebContentsView()
rightView.webContents.loadURL('https://github.com/electron/electron')
win.contentView.addChildView(rightView)

leftView.setBounds({ x: 0, y: 0, width: 400, height: 600 })
rightView.setBounds({ x: 400, y: 0, width: 400, height: 600 })
```

## Parent and child windows[â](#parent-and-child-windows "Direct link to Parent and child windows")

By using `parent` option, you can create child windows:

```
const { BaseWindow } = require('electron')

const parent = new BaseWindow()
const child = new BaseWindow({ parent })
```

The `child` window will always show on top of the `parent` window.

## Modal windows[â](#modal-windows "Direct link to Modal windows")

A modal window is a child window that disables parent window. To create a modal
window, you have to set both the `parent` and `modal` options:

```
const { BaseWindow } = require('electron')

const parent = new BaseWindow()
const child = new BaseWindow({ parent, modal: true })
```

## Platform notices[â](#platform-notices "Direct link to Platform notices")

* On macOS modal windows will be displayed as sheets attached to the parent window.
* On macOS the child windows will keep the relative position to parent window
when parent window moves, while on Windows and Linux child windows will not
move.
* On Linux the type of modal windows will be changed to `dialog`.
* On Linux many desktop environments do not support hiding a modal window.

## Resource management[â](#resource-management "Direct link to Resource management")

When you add a [`WebContentsView`](/docs/latest/api/web-contents-view) to a `BaseWindow` and the `BaseWindow`
is closed, the [`webContents`](/docs/latest/api/web-contents) of the `WebContentsView` are not destroyed
automatically.

It is your responsibility to close the `webContents` when you no longer need them, e.g. when
the `BaseWindow` is closed:

```
const { BaseWindow, WebContentsView } = require('electron')

const win = new BaseWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 })

const view = new WebContentsView()
win.contentView.addChildView(view)

win.on('closed', () => {
view.webContents.close()
})
```

Unlike with a [`BrowserWindow`](/docs/latest/api/browser-window), if you don't explicitly close the
`webContents`, you'll encounter memory leaks.

## Class: BaseWindow[â](#class-basewindow "Direct link to Class: BaseWindow")

> Create and control windows.

Process: [Main](/docs/latest/glossary#main-process)

`BaseWindow` is an [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter).

It creates a new `BaseWindow` with native properties as set by the `options`.

warning

Electron's built-in classes cannot be subclassed in user code.

Default is to center the window.
+ `useContentSize` boolean (optional) - The `width` and `height` would be used as web
page's size, which means the actual window's size will include window
frame's size and be slightly larger. Default is `false`.

+ `focusable` boolean (optional) - Whether the window can be focused. Default is
`true`. On Windows setting `focusable: false` also implies setting
`skipTaskbar: true`. On Linux setting `focusable: false` makes the window
stop interacting with wm, so the window will always stay on top in all
workspaces.
+ `alwaysOnTop` boolean (optional) - Whether the window should always stay on top of
other windows. Default is `false`.
+ `fullscreen` boolean (optional) - Whether the window should show in fullscreen. When
explicitly set to `false` the fullscreen button will be hidden or disabled
on macOS. Default is `false`.
+ `fullscreenable` boolean (optional) - Whether the window can be put into fullscreen
mode. On macOS, also whether the maximize/zoom button should toggle full
screen mode or maximize window. Default is `true`.
+ `simpleFullscreen` boolean (optional) *macOS* - Use pre-Lion fullscreen on
macOS. Default is `false`.

+ `icon` ([NativeImage](/docs/latest/api/native-image) | string) (optional) - The window icon. On Windows it is
recommended to use `ICO` icons to get best visual effects, you can also
leave it undefined so the executable's icon will be used.
+ `show` boolean (optional) - Whether window should be shown when created. Default is
`true`.
+ `frame` boolean (optional) - Specify `false` to create a
[frameless window](/docs/latest/tutorial/custom-window-styles#frameless-windows). Default is `true`.
+ `parent` BaseWindow (optional) - Specify parent window. Default is `null`.
+ `modal` boolean (optional) - Whether this is a modal window. This only works when the
window is a child window. Default is `false`.
+ `acceptFirstMouse` boolean (optional) *macOS* - Whether clicking an
inactive window will also click through to the web contents. Default is
`false` on macOS. This option is not configurable on other platforms.
+ `disableAutoHideCursor` boolean (optional) - Whether to hide cursor when typing.
Default is `false`.
+ `autoHideMenuBar` boolean (optional) *Linux* *Windows* - Auto hide the menu bar
unless the `Alt` key is pressed. Default is `false`.

be resized larger than screen. Only relevant for macOS, as other OSes
allow larger-than-screen windows by default. Default is `false`.
+ `backgroundColor` string (optional) - The window's background color in Hex, RGB, RGBA, HSL, HSLA or named CSS color format. Alpha in #AARRGGBB format is supported if `transparent` is set to `true`. Default is `#FFF` (white). See [win.setBackgroundColor](/docs/latest/api/browser-window#winsetbackgroundcolorbackgroundcolor) for more information.
+ `hasShadow` boolean (optional) - Whether window should have a shadow. Default is `true`.
+ `opacity` number (optional) *macOS* *Windows* - Set the initial opacity of
the window, between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque). This
is only implemented on Windows and macOS.
+ `darkTheme` boolean (optional) - Forces using dark theme for the window, only works on
some GTK+3 desktop environments. Default is `false`.
+ `transparent` boolean (optional) - Makes the window [transparent](/docs/latest/tutorial/custom-window-styles#transparent-windows).
Default is `false`. On Windows, does not work unless the window is frameless.
When you add a [`View`](/docs/latest/api/view) to a `BaseWindow`, you'll need to call
[`view.setBackgroundColor`](/docs/latest/api/view#viewsetbackgroundcolorcolor) with a transparent
background color on that view to make its background transparent as well.
+ `type` string (optional) - The type of window, default is normal window. See more about
this below.
+ `visualEffectState` string (optional) *macOS* - Specify how the material
appearance should reflect window activity state on macOS. Must be used
with the `vibrancy` property. Possible values are:
- `followWindow` - The backdrop should automatically appear active when the window is active, and inactive when it is not. This is the default.
- `active` - The backdrop should always appear active.
- `inactive` - The backdrop should always appear inactive.
+ `titleBarStyle` string (optional) - The style of window title bar.
Default is `default`. Possible values are:
- `default` - Results in the standard title bar for macOS or Windows respectively.
- `hidden` - Results in a hidden title bar and a full size content window. On macOS, the window still has the standard window controls (âtraffic lightsâ) in the top left. On Windows and Linux, when combined with `titleBarOverlay: true` it will activate the Window Controls Overlay (see `titleBarOverlay` for more information), otherwise no window controls will be shown.
- `hiddenInset` *macOS* - Results in a hidden title bar
with an alternative look where the traffic light buttons are slightly
more inset from the window edge.
- `customButtonsOnHover` *macOS* - Results in a hidden
title bar and a full size content window, the traffic light buttons will
display when being hovered over in the top left of the window.
**Note:** This option is currently experimental.
+ `titleBarOverlay` Object | Boolean (optional) - When using a frameless window in conjunction with `win.setWindowButtonVisibility(true)` on macOS or using a `titleBarStyle` so that the standard window controls ("traffic lights" on macOS) are visible, this property enables the Window Controls Overlay [JavaScript APIs](https://github.com/WICG/window-controls-overlay/blob/main/explainer.md#javascript-apis) and [CSS Environment Variables](https://github.com/WICG/window-controls-overlay/blob/main/explainer.md#css-environment-variables). Specifying `true` will result in an overlay with default system colors. Default is `false`.
- `color` String (optional) *Windows* *Linux* - The CSS color of the Window Controls Overlay when enabled. Default is the system color.
- `symbolColor` String (optional) *Windows* *Linux* - The CSS color of the symbols on the Window Controls Overlay when enabled. Default is the system color.
- `height` Integer (optional) - The height of the title bar and Window Controls Overlay in pixels. Default is system height.
+ `accentColor` boolean | string (optional) *Windows* - The accent color for the window. By default, follows user preference in System Settings. Set to `false` to explicitly disable, or set the color in Hex, RGB, RGBA, HSL, HSLA or named CSS color format. Alpha values will be ignored.
+ `trafficLightPosition` [Point](/docs/latest/api/structures/point) (optional) *macOS* -
Set a custom position for the traffic light buttons in frameless windows.
+ `roundedCorners` boolean (optional) *macOS* *Windows* - Whether frameless window
should have rounded corners. Default is `true`. On Windows versions older than
Windows 11 Build 22000 this property has no effect, and frameless windows will
not have rounded corners.
+ `thickFrame` boolean (optional) *Windows* - Use `WS_THICKFRAME` style for
frameless windows on Windows, which adds the standard window frame. Setting it
to `false` will remove window shadow and window animations, and disable window
resizing via dragging the window edges. Default is `true`.
+ `vibrancy` string (optional) *macOS* - Add a type of vibrancy effect to
the window, only on macOS. Can be `appearance-based`, `titlebar`, `selection`,
`menu`, `popover`, `sidebar`, `header`, `sheet`, `window`, `hud`, `fullscreen-ui`,
`tooltip`, `content`, `under-window`, or `under-page`.
+ `backgroundMaterial` string (optional) *Windows* - Set the window's
system-drawn background material, including behind the non-client area.
Can be `auto`, `none`, `mica`, `acrylic` or `tabbed`. See [win.setBackgroundMaterial](/docs/latest/api/browser-window#winsetbackgroundmaterialmaterial-windows) for more information.
+ `zoomToPageWidth` boolean (optional) *macOS* - Controls the behavior on
macOS when option-clicking the green stoplight button on the toolbar or by
clicking the Window > Zoom menu item. If `true`, the window will grow to
the preferred width of the web page when zoomed, `false` will cause it to
zoom to the width of the screen. This will also affect the behavior when
calling `maximize()` directly. Default is `false`.
+ `tabbingIdentifier` string (optional) *macOS* - Tab group name, allows
opening the window as a native tab. Windows with the same
tabbing identifier will be grouped together. This also adds a native new
tab button to your window's tab bar and allows your `app` and window to
receive the `new-window-for-tab` event.

When setting minimum or maximum window size with `minWidth`/`maxWidth`/
`minHeight`/`maxHeight`, it only constrains the users. It won't prevent you from
passing a size that does not follow size constraints to `setBounds`/`setSize` or
to the constructor of `BrowserWindow`.

The possible values and behaviors of the `type` option are platform dependent.
Possible values are:

+ On Linux, possible types are `desktop`, `dock`, `toolbar`, `splash`,
`notification`.
- The `desktop` type places the window at the desktop background window level
(kCGDesktopWindowLevel - 1). However, note that a desktop window will not
receive focus, keyboard, or mouse events. You can still use globalShortcut to
receive input sparingly.
- The `dock` type creates a dock-like window behavior.
- The `toolbar` type creates a window with a toolbar appearance.
- The `splash` type behaves in a specific way. It is not
draggable, even if the CSS styling of the window's body contains
-webkit-app-region: drag. This type is commonly used for splash screens.
- The `notification` type creates a window that behaves like a system notification.
+ On macOS, possible types are `desktop`, `textured`, `panel`.
- The `textured` type adds metal gradient appearance. This option is **deprecated**.
- The `desktop` type places the window at the desktop background window level
(`kCGDesktopWindowLevel - 1`). Note that desktop window will not receive
focus, keyboard or mouse events, but you can use `globalShortcut` to receive
input sparingly.
- The `panel` type enables the window to float on top of full-screened apps
by adding the `NSWindowStyleMaskNonactivatingPanel` style mask, normally
reserved for NSPanel, at runtime. Also, the window will appear on all
spaces (desktops).
+ On Windows, possible type is `toolbar`.

### Instance Events[â](#instance-events "Direct link to Instance Events")

Objects created with `new BaseWindow` emit the following events:

note

Some events are only available on specific operating systems and are
labeled as such.

#### Event: 'close'[â](#event-close "Direct link to Event: 'close'")

Returns:

* `event` Event

Emitted when the window is going to be closed. It's emitted before the
`beforeunload` and `unload` event of the DOM. Calling `event.preventDefault()`
will cancel the close.

Usually you would want to use the `beforeunload` handler to decide whether the
window should be closed, which will also be called when the window is
reloaded. In Electron, returning any value other than `undefined` would cancel the
close. For example:

```
window.onbeforeunload = (e) => {
console.log('I do not want to be closed')

// Unlike usual browsers that a message box will be prompted to users, returning
// a non-void value will silently cancel the close.
// It is recommended to use the dialog API to let the user confirm closing the
// application.
e.returnValue = false
}
```

note

There is a subtle difference between the behaviors of `window.onbeforeunload = handler` and
`window.addEventListener('beforeunload', handler)`. It is recommended to always set the
`event.returnValue` explicitly, instead of only returning a value, as the former works more
consistently within Electron.

#### Event: 'closed'[â](#event-closed "Direct link to Event: 'closed'")

Emitted when the window is closed. After you have received this event you should
remove the reference to the window and avoid using it any more.

#### Event: 'query-session-end' *Windows*[â](#event-query-session-end-windows "Direct link to event-query-session-end-windows")

Returns:

* `event` [WindowSessionEndEvent](/docs/latest/api/structures/window-session-end-event)

Emitted when a session is about to end due to a shutdown, machine restart, or user log-off.
Calling `event.preventDefault()` can delay the system shutdown, though itâs generally best
to respect the userâs choice to end the session. However, you may choose to use it if
ending the session puts the user at risk of losing data.

#### Event: 'session-end' *Windows*[â](#event-session-end-windows "Direct link to event-session-end-windows")

Returns:

* `event` [WindowSessionEndEvent](/docs/latest/api/structures/window-session-end-event)

Emitted when a session is about to end due to a shutdown, machine restart, or user log-off. Once this event fires, there is no way to prevent the session from ending.

#### Event: 'blur'[â](#event-blur "Direct link to Event: 'blur'")

Returns:

* `event` Event

Emitted when the window loses focus.

#### Event: 'focus'[â](#event-focus "Direct link to Event: 'focus'")

Returns:

* `event` Event

Emitted when the window gains focus.

#### Event: 'show'[â](#event-show "Direct link to Event: 'show'")

Emitted when the window is shown.

#### Event: 'hide'[â](#event-hide "Direct link to Event: 'hide'")

Emitted when the window is hidden.

#### Event: 'maximize'[â](#event-maximize "Direct link to Event: 'maximize'")

Emitted when window is maximized.

#### Event: 'unmaximize'[â](#event-unmaximize "Direct link to Event: 'unmaximize'")

Emitted when the window exits from a maximized state.

#### Event: 'minimize'[â](#event-minimize "Direct link to Event: 'minimize'")

Emitted when the window is minimized.

#### Event: 'restore'[â](#event-restore "Direct link to Event: 'restore'")

Emitted when the window is restored from a minimized state.

#### Event: 'will-resize' *macOS* *Windows*[â](#event-will-resize-macos-windows "Direct link to event-will-resize-macos-windows")

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `newBounds` [Rectangle](/docs/latest/api/structures/rectangle) - Size the window is being resized to.
* `details` Object
+ `edge` (string) - The edge of the window being dragged for resizing. Can be `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left` or `bottom-right`.

Emitted before the window is resized. Calling `event.preventDefault()` will prevent the window from being resized.

Note that this is only emitted when the window is being resized manually. Resizing the window with `setBounds`/`setSize` will not emit this event.

The possible values and behaviors of the `edge` option are platform dependent. Possible values are:

* On Windows, possible values are `bottom`, `top`, `left`, `right`, `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right`.
* On macOS, possible values are `bottom` and `right`.
+ The value `bottom` is used to denote vertical resizing.
+ The value `right` is used to denote horizontal resizing.

#### Event: 'resize'[â](#event-resize "Direct link to Event: 'resize'")

Emitted after the window has been resized.

#### Event: 'resized' *macOS* *Windows*[â](#event-resized-macos-windows "Direct link to event-resized-macos-windows")

Emitted once when the window has finished being resized.

This is usually emitted when the window has been resized manually. On macOS, resizing the window with `setBounds`/`setSize` and setting the `animate` parameter to `true` will also emit this event once resizing has finished.

#### Event: 'will-move' *macOS* *Windows*[â](#event-will-move-macos-windows "Direct link to event-will-move-macos-windows")

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `newBounds` [Rectangle](/docs/latest/api/structures/rectangle) - Location the window is being moved to.

Emitted before the window is moved. On Windows, calling `event.preventDefault()` will prevent the window from being moved.

Note that this is only emitted when the window is being moved manually. Moving the window with `setPosition`/`setBounds`/`center` will not emit this event.

#### Event: 'move'[â](#event-move "Direct link to Event: 'move'")

Emitted when the window is being moved to a new position.

#### Event: 'moved' *macOS* *Windows*[â](#event-moved-macos-windows "Direct link to event-moved-macos-windows")

Emitted once when the window is moved to a new position.

note

On macOS, this event is an alias of `move`.

#### Event: 'enter-full-screen'[â](#event-enter-full-screen "Direct link to Event: 'enter-full-screen'")

Emitted when the window enters a full-screen state.

#### Event: 'leave-full-screen'[â](#event-leave-full-screen "Direct link to Event: 'leave-full-screen'")

Emitted when the window leaves a full-screen state.

#### Event: 'always-on-top-changed'[â](#event-always-on-top-changed "Direct link to Event: 'always-on-top-changed'")

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `isAlwaysOnTop` boolean

Emitted when the window is set or unset to show always on top of other windows.

#### Event: 'app-command' *Windows* *Linux*[â](#event-app-command-windows-linux "Direct link to event-app-command-windows-linux")

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `command` string

Emitted when an [App Command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/wm-appcommand)
is invoked. These are typically related to keyboard media keys or browser
commands, as well as the "Back" button built into some mice on Windows.

Commands are lowercased, underscores are replaced with hyphens, and the
`APPCOMMAND_` prefix is stripped off.
e.g. `APPCOMMAND_BROWSER_BACKWARD` is emitted as `browser-backward`.

```
const { BaseWindow } = require('electron')

const win = new BaseWindow()
win.on('app-command', (e, cmd) => {
// Navigate the window back when the user hits their mouse back button
if (cmd === 'browser-backward') {
// Find the appropriate WebContents to navigate.
}
})
```

The following app commands are explicitly supported on Linux:

* `browser-backward`
* `browser-forward`

#### Event: 'swipe' *macOS*[â](#event-swipe-macos "Direct link to event-swipe-macos")

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `direction` string

Emitted on 3-finger swipe. Possible directions are `up`, `right`, `down`, `left`.

The method underlying this event is built to handle older macOS-style trackpad swiping,
where the content on the screen doesn't move with the swipe. Most macOS trackpads are not
configured to allow this kind of swiping anymore, so in order for it to emit properly the
'Swipe between pages' preference in `System Preferences > Trackpad > More Gestures` must be
set to 'Swipe with two or three fingers'.

#### Event: 'rotate-gesture' *macOS*[â](#event-rotate-gesture-macos "Direct link to event-rotate-gesture-macos")

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `rotation` Float

Emitted on trackpad rotation gesture. Continually emitted until rotation gesture is
ended. The `rotation` value on each emission is the angle in degrees rotated since
the last emission. The last emitted event upon a rotation gesture will always be of
value `0`. Counter-clockwise rotation values are positive, while clockwise ones are
negative.

#### Event: 'sheet-begin' *macOS*[â](#event-sheet-begin-macos "Direct link to event-sheet-begin-macos")

Emitted when the window opens a sheet.

#### Event: 'sheet-end' *macOS*[â](#event-sheet-end-macos "Direct link to event-sheet-end-macos")

Emitted when the window has closed a sheet.

#### Event: 'new-window-for-tab' *macOS*[â](#event-new-window-for-tab-macos "Direct link to event-new-window-for-tab-macos")

Emitted when the native new tab button is clicked.

#### Event: 'system-context-menu' *Windows* *Linux*[â](#event-system-context-menu-windows-linux "Direct link to event-system-context-menu-windows-linux")

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `point` [Point](/docs/latest/api/structures/point) - The screen coordinates where the context menu was triggered.

Emitted when the system context menu is triggered on the window, this is
normally only triggered when the user right clicks on the non-client area
of your window. This is the window titlebar or any area you have declared
as `-webkit-app-region: drag` in a frameless window.

Calling `event.preventDefault()` will prevent the menu from being displayed.

To convert `point` to DIP, use [`screen.screenToDipPoint(point)`](/docs/latest/api/screen#screenscreentodippointpoint-windows-linux).

### Static Methods[â](#static-methods "Direct link to Static Methods")

The `BaseWindow` class has the following static methods:

#### `BaseWindow.getAllWindows()`[â](#basewindowgetallwindows "Direct link to basewindowgetallwindows")

Returns `BaseWindow[]` - An array of all opened browser windows.

#### `BaseWindow.getFocusedWindow()`[â](#basewindowgetfocusedwindow "Direct link to basewindowgetfocusedwindow")

Returns `BaseWindow | null` - The window that is focused in this application, otherwise returns `null`.

#### `BaseWindow.fromId(id)`[â](#basewindowfromidid "Direct link to basewindowfromidid")

* `id` Integer

Returns `BaseWindow | null` - The window with the given `id`.

### Instance Properties[â](#instance-properties "Direct link to Instance Properties")

Objects created with `new BaseWindow` have the following properties:

```
const { BaseWindow } = require('electron')
// In this example `win` is our instance
const win = new BaseWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 })
```

#### `win.id` *Readonly*[â](#winid-readonly "Direct link to winid-readonly")

A `Integer` property representing the unique ID of the window. Each ID is unique among all `BaseWindow` instances of the entire Electron application.

#### `win.contentView`[â](#wincontentview "Direct link to wincontentview")

A `View` property for the content view of the window.

#### `win.tabbingIdentifier` *macOS* *Readonly*[â](#wintabbingidentifier-macos-readonly "Direct link to wintabbingidentifier-macos-readonly")

A `string` (optional) property that is equal to the `tabbingIdentifier` passed to the `BrowserWindow` constructor or `undefined` if none was set.

#### `win.autoHideMenuBar` *Linux* *Windows*[â](#winautohidemenubar-linux-windows "Direct link to winautohidemenubar-linux-windows")

A `boolean` property that determines whether the window menu bar should hide itself automatically. Once set, the menu bar will only show when users press the single `Alt` key.

If the menu bar is already visible, setting this property to `true` won't
hide it immediately.

#### `win.simpleFullScreen`[â](#winsimplefullscreen "Direct link to winsimplefullscreen")

A `boolean` property that determines whether the window is in simple (pre-Lion) fullscreen mode.

#### `win.fullScreen`[â](#winfullscreen "Direct link to winfullscreen")

A `boolean` property that determines whether the window is in fullscreen mode.

#### `win.focusable` *Windows* *macOS*[â](#winfocusable-windows-macos "Direct link to winfocusable-windows-macos")

A `boolean` property that determines whether the window is focusable.

#### `win.visibleOnAllWorkspaces` *macOS* *Linux*[â](#winvisibleonallworkspaces-macos-linux "Direct link to winvisibleonallworkspaces-macos-linux")

A `boolean` property that determines whether the window is visible on all workspaces.

note

Always returns false on Windows.

#### `win.shadow`[â](#winshadow "Direct link to winshadow")

A `boolean` property that determines whether the window has a shadow.

#### `win.menuBarVisible` *Windows* *Linux*[â](#winmenubarvisible-windows-linux "Direct link to winmenubarvisible-windows-linux")

A `boolean` property that determines whether the menu bar should be visible.

note

#### `win.setAspectRatio(aspectRatio[, extraSize])`[â](#winsetaspectratioaspectratio-extrasize "Direct link to winsetaspectratioaspectratio-extrasize")

* `aspectRatio` Float - The aspect ratio to maintain for some portion of the
content view.
* `extraSize` [Size](/docs/latest/api/structures/size) (optional) *macOS* - The extra size not to be included while
maintaining the aspect ratio.

This will make a window maintain an aspect ratio. The extra size allows a
developer to have space, specified in pixels, not included within the aspect
ratio calculations. This API already takes into account the difference between a
window's size and its content size.

Consider a normal window with an HD video player and associated controls.
Perhaps there are 15 pixels of controls on the left edge, 25 pixels of controls
on the right edge and 50 pixels of controls below the player. In order to
maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio (standard aspect ratio for HD @1920x1080) within
the player itself we would call this function with arguments of 16/9 and
{ width: 40, height: 50 }. The second argument doesn't care where the extra width and height
are within the content view--only that they exist. Sum any extra width and
height areas you have within the overall content view.

The aspect ratio is not respected when window is resized programmatically with
APIs like `win.setSize`.

To reset an aspect ratio, pass 0 as the `aspectRatio` value: `win.setAspectRatio(0)`.

#### `win.setBackgroundColor(backgroundColor)`[â](#winsetbackgroundcolorbackgroundcolor "Direct link to winsetbackgroundcolorbackgroundcolor")

* `backgroundColor` string - Color in Hex, RGB, RGBA, HSL, HSLA or named CSS color format. The alpha channel is optional for the hex type.

Examples of valid `backgroundColor` values:

* Hex
+ #fff (shorthand RGB)
+ #ffff (shorthand ARGB)
+ #ffffff (RGB)
+ #ffffffff (ARGB)
* RGB
+ `rgb\(([\d]+),\s*([\d]+),\s*([\d]+)\)`
- e.g. rgb(255, 255, 255)
* RGBA
+ `rgba\(([\d]+),\s*([\d]+),\s*([\d]+),\s*([\d.]+)\)`
- e.g. rgba(255, 255, 255, 1.0)
* HSL
+ `hsl\((-?[\d.]+),\s*([\d.]+)%,\s*([\d.]+)%\)`
- e.g. hsl(200, 20%, 50%)
* HSLA
+ `hsla\((-?[\d.]+),\s*([\d.]+)%,\s*([\d.]+)%,\s*([\d.]+)\)`
- e.g. hsla(200, 20%, 50%, 0.5)
* Color name
+ Options are listed in [SkParseColor.cpp](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/skia/src/utils/SkParseColor.cpp;l=11-152;drc=eea4bf52cb0d55e2a39c828b017c80a5ee054148)
+ Similar to CSS Color Module Level 3 keywords, but case-sensitive.
- e.g. `blueviolet` or `red`

Sets the background color of the window. See [Setting `backgroundColor`](/docs/latest/api/browser-window#setting-the-backgroundcolor-property).

#### `win.previewFile(path[, displayName])` *macOS*[â](#winpreviewfilepath-displayname-macos "Direct link to winpreviewfilepath-displayname-macos")

* `path` string - The absolute path to the file to preview with QuickLook. This
is important as Quick Look uses the file name and file extension on the path
to determine the content type of the file to open.
* `displayName` string (optional) - The name of the file to display on the
Quick Look modal view. This is purely visual and does not affect the content
type of the file. Defaults to `path`.

Uses [Quick Look](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_Look) to preview a file at a given path.

#### `win.closeFilePreview()` *macOS*[â](#winclosefilepreview-macos "Direct link to winclosefilepreview-macos")

Closes the currently open [Quick Look](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_Look) panel.

#### `win.setBounds(bounds[, animate])`[â](#winsetboundsbounds-animate "Direct link to winsetboundsbounds-animate")

* `bounds` Partial<[Rectangle](/docs/latest/api/structures/rectangle)>
* `animate` boolean (optional) *macOS*

Resizes and moves the window to the supplied bounds. Any properties that are not supplied will default to their current values.

```
const { BaseWindow } = require('electron')

const win = new BaseWindow()

// set all bounds properties
win.setBounds({ x: 440, y: 225, width: 800, height: 600 })

// set a single bounds property
win.setBounds({ width: 100 })

// { x: 440, y: 225, width: 100, height: 600 }
console.log(win.getBounds())
```

note

On macOS, the y-coordinate value cannot be smaller than the [Tray](/docs/latest/api/tray) height. The tray height has changed over time and depends on the operating system, but is between 20-40px. Passing a value lower than the tray height will result in a window that is flush to the tray.

#### `win.getBounds()`[â](#wingetbounds "Direct link to wingetbounds")

Returns [Rectangle](/docs/latest/api/structures/rectangle) - The `bounds` of the window as `Object`.

note

On macOS, the y-coordinate value returned will be at minimum the [Tray](/docs/latest/api/tray) height. For example, calling `win.setBounds({ x: 25, y: 20, width: 800, height: 600 })` with a tray height of 38 means that `win.getBounds()` will return `{ x: 25, y: 38, width: 800, height: 600 }`.

#### `win.getBackgroundColor()`[â](#wingetbackgroundcolor "Direct link to wingetbackgroundcolor")

Returns `string` - Gets the background color of the window in Hex (`#RRGGBB`) format.

See [Setting `backgroundColor`](/docs/latest/api/browser-window#setting-the-backgroundcolor-property).

Remove progress bar when progress < 0;
Change to indeterminate mode when progress > 1.

On Linux platform, only supports Unity desktop environment, you need to specify
the `*.desktop` file name to `desktopName` field in `package.json`. By default,
it will assume `{app.name}.desktop`.

On Windows, a mode can be passed. Accepted values are `none`, `normal`,
`indeterminate`, `error`, and `paused`. If you call `setProgressBar` without a
mode set (but with a value within the valid range), `normal` will be assumed.

#### `win.setOverlayIcon(overlay, description)` *Windows*[â](#winsetoverlayiconoverlay-description-windows "Direct link to winsetoverlayiconoverlay-description-windows")

`BaseWindow`s that are transparent can sometimes leave behind visual artifacts on macOS.
This method can be used to clear these artifacts when, for example, performing an animation.

#### `win.setHasShadow(hasShadow)`[â](#winsethasshadowhasshadow "Direct link to winsethasshadowhasshadow")

* `hasShadow` boolean

Sets whether the window should have a shadow.

Setting a window shape determines the area within the window where the system
permits drawing and user interaction. Outside of the given region, no pixels
will be drawn and no mouse events will be registered. Mouse events outside of
the region will not be received by that window, but will fall through to
whatever is behind the window.

* `buttons` [ThumbarButton[]](/docs/latest/api/structures/thumbar-button)

Returns `boolean` - Whether the buttons were added successfully

Add a thumbnail toolbar with a specified set of buttons to the thumbnail image
of a window in a taskbar button layout. Returns a `boolean` object indicates
whether the thumbnail has been added successfully.

The number of buttons in thumbnail toolbar should be no greater than 7 due to
the limited room. Once you setup the thumbnail toolbar, the toolbar cannot be
removed due to the platform's limitation. But you can call the API with an empty
array to clean the buttons.

The `buttons` is an array of `Button` objects:

* `Button` Object
+ `icon` [NativeImage](/docs/latest/api/native-image) - The icon showing in thumbnail
toolbar.
+ `click` Function
+ `tooltip` string (optional) - The text of the button's tooltip.
+ `flags` string[] (optional) - Control specific states and behaviors of the
button. By default, it is `['enabled']`.

The `flags` is an array that can include following `string`s:

* `enabled` - The button is active and available to the user.
* `disabled` - The button is disabled. It is present, but has a visual state
indicating it will not respond to user action.
* `dismissonclick` - When the button is clicked, the thumbnail window closes
immediately.
* `nobackground` - Do not draw a button border, use only the image.
* `hidden` - The button is not shown to the user.
* `noninteractive` - The button is enabled but not interactive; no pressed
button state is drawn. This value is intended for instances where the button
is used in a notification.

#### `win.setThumbnailClip(region)` *Windows*[â](#winsetthumbnailclipregion-windows "Direct link to winsetthumbnailclipregion-windows")

* `region` [Rectangle](/docs/latest/api/structures/rectangle) - Region of the window

Sets the region of the window to show as the thumbnail image displayed when
hovering over the window in the taskbar. You can reset the thumbnail to be
the entire window by specifying an empty region:
`{ x: 0, y: 0, width: 0, height: 0 }`.

+ `appIconIndex` Integer (optional) - Index of the icon in `appIconPath`.
Ignored when `appIconPath` is not set. Default is `0`.
+ `relaunchCommand` string (optional) - Window's [Relaunch Command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/properties/props-system-appusermodel-relaunchcommand).
+ `relaunchDisplayName` string (optional) - Window's [Relaunch Display Name](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/properties/props-system-appusermodel-relaunchdisplaynameresource).

Sets the properties for the window's taskbar button.

note

`relaunchCommand` and `relaunchDisplayName` must always be set
together. If one of those properties is not set, then neither will be used.

#### `win.setAccentColor(accentColor)` *Windows*[â](#winsetaccentcoloraccentcolor-windows "Direct link to winsetaccentcoloraccentcolor-windows")

* `accentColor` boolean | string | null - The accent color for the window. By default, follows user preference in System Settings. To reset to system default, pass `null`.

Sets the system accent color and highlighting of active window border.

The `accentColor` parameter accepts the following values:

* **Color string** - Like `true`, but sets a custom accent color using standard CSS color formats (Hex, RGB, RGBA, HSL, HSLA, or named colors). Alpha values in RGBA/HSLA formats are ignored and the color is treated as fully opaque.
* **`true`** - Enable accent color highlighting for the window with the system accent color regardless of whether accent colors are enabled for windows in System `Settings.`
* **`false`** - Disable accent color highlighting for the window regardless of whether accent colors are currently enabled for windows in System Settings.
* **`null`** - Reset window accent color behavior to follow behavior set in System Settings.

Examples:

```
const win = new BrowserWindow({ frame: false })

// Set red accent color.
win.setAccentColor('#ff0000')

// RGB format (alpha ignored if present).
win.setAccentColor('rgba(255,0,0,0.5)')

// Enable accent color, using the color specified in System Settings.
win.setAccentColor(true)

// Disable accent color.
win.setAccentColor(false)

// Reset window accent color behavior to follow behavior set in System Settings.
win.setAccentColor(null)
```

#### `win.getAccentColor()` *Windows*[â](#wingetaccentcolor-windows "Direct link to wingetaccentcolor-windows")

Returns `string | boolean` - the system accent color and highlighting of active window border in Hex RGB format.

If a color has been set for the window that differs from the system accent color, the window accent color will
be returned. Otherwise, a boolean will be returned, with `true` indicating that the window uses the global system accent color, and `false` indicating that accent color highlighting is disabled for this window.

type between UIElementApplication and ForegroundApplication to
ensure the correct behavior. However, this will hide the window
and dock for a short time every time it is called. If your window
is already of type UIElementApplication, you can bypass this
transformation by passing true to skipTransformProcessType.

Sets whether the window should be visible on all workspaces.
